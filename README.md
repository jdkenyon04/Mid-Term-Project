# Mid-Term-Project

Thing to do:
1. Being program with menu, continues to loop until user types 6 (exit) or something
    a. I think do this in main, Print out all methods with a number connected to them. Read the line the user puts it and use the function correpsonding with the number.
    b. have a boolean variable set to true, and use a while loop. When user puts the exit number in set the variable to false
2. Stretch Goals
3. Double Check firePlayer with Prof.
4. Double Check printByPlayer to see if I can do it without capitals
5. Double Check how to print something in color with prof.
6. Double Check on how to compare only first character of two Strings with prof.
7. Test all funciton in main.
